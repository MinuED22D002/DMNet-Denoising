Input: Noisy Point Cloud (N points, 6D features)
       Graph Structure (tetrahedra, facets)
↓
[Point Feature Extraction]
  - MLP: 6D → 64D → 128D
↓
[Cell Feature Extraction]  
  - Aggregate point features per tetrahedron
  - MLP: 4D geom + point features → 128D
↓
[Graph Convolution Layers × 3]
  - Message passing along tetrahedron adjacency
  - Share information between neighboring cells
↓
[Facet Processing]
  - Extract facet features from adjacent cells
  - Learn facet-level representations
↓
[Point Offset Prediction]
  - MLP: 128D → 64D → 3D offsets
  - Output: Δx, Δy, Δz for each point
↓
Denoised Points = Noisy Points + Predicted Offsets
